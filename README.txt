scraper.py runs using python 3 

Half of the code is just setting up the links, and the other half is sorting the links by most popularly found on various websites.

I believe they wanted me to find the median, but I thought google wanted the mode so I just sorted list using a simple merge sort algorithm.

Please let me know how the project is, or what I can do to "find the median" instead!
